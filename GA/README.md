# Evolve a neural network with a genetic algorithm

This is an code used to find the optimal network parameters for trait regression task. 
It's  a fork of [Jan Liphardt's implementation, DeepEvolve](https://github.com/jliphard/DeepEvolve) to work with MLPs and CNNs. It uses the Keras library to build, train and validate.

## To run


```python main.py```


## Credits

The genetic algorithm code is based on the code from this excellent blog post: https://lethain.com/genetic-algorithms-cool-name-damn-simple/ and this excelent repository: https://github.com/rileymcdowell/genomic-neuralnet

It's a fork of [Jan Liphardt's implementation, DeepEvolve](https://github.com/jliphard/DeepEvolve)
