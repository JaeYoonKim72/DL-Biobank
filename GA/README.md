# Evolve a neural network with a genetic algorithm

This is an code used to find the optimal network parameters for trait regression task. 
It's currently limited to only MLPs (ie. fully connected networks) and uses the Keras library to build, train and validate.

For a more robust implementation that you can use in your projects, take a look at [Jan Liphardt's implementation, DeepEvolve](https://github.com/jliphard/DeepEvolve).

## To run


```python main.py```
