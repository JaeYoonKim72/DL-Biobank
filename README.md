# Can deep learning improve genomic prediction of complex human traits? by Pau Bellot, Gustavo de los Campos, Miguel PÃ©rez-Enciso, Genetics.
This repo contains the code to reproduce the experiments of the paper [Can deep learning improve genomic prediction of complex human traits?](http://www.genetics.org/content/210/3/809).


## Before you start

- Download and install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#keras-the-python-deep-learning-library).
  - The file ```requirements.txt``` contains a simple list of all the packages in the current environment, and their respective versions.
- Download the biobank dataset and traits.
  - Save genotypes
  - Save phenotypes in a csv, each trait should be in a column
- Run a GWAS for all traits and save the results in a csv file
  - This csv should have the p-values of each SNP for each trait (in columns)
#### data
- data/ folder contains the GWAS for all the traits used in the paper
## To run

#### Train MLPs models for height with 10k Best SNPS 
```python main.py --mlp --trait height```

#### Train CNNs models for height with 10k Unif SNPS 
```python main.py --cnn --trait height --unif```

#### Train MLPs models for BHMD with 50k Best SNPS 
```python main.py --mlp --trait BHMD --unif -k 50000```

#### Deep learning hyperparamer tuning 
- see GA directory

#### To generate the figures eneration
- see notebook and R code
