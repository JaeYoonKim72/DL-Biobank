# Can deep learning improve genomic prediction of complex human traits?
This repo contains the code to reproduce the experiments of the paper[Can deep learning improve genomic prediction of complex human traits?](https://arxiv.org/...).


## Before you start

- Download and install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#keras-the-python-deep-learning-library).
- Download the biobank dataset and traits.
- Run a GWAS for all traits

## To run

#### Train linar and MLPs models for all traits
```python main.py```

#### Simulation
- see simulation directory

#### Deep learning hyperparamer tuning 
- see neural-network-genetic-algorithm directory

#### Figure 1 generation
- see Figure 1 notebook
